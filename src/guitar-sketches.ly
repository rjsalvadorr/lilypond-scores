          This book started as a personal collection of exercises to get better at improvising on guitar, but it turned into a compact system that could help other guitarists as well. So I cleaned up what exercises I had, and decided to share this with others.

        \wordwrap {
          I've laid out sixteen exercises for improving guitar fluency by memorizing a series of patterns on the fingerboard. These patterns all build on each other, and are especially effective when combined with music theory knowledge.

        \hspace #0
        \wordwrap {
          The exercises here build up technical and improvisation mastery by building on three main skills:
        }
        \hspace #0
        \hspace #0
        \italic "1. Playing melodies over various chords in any key"
        \italic "2. Playing various chords in any position on the fretboard"
        \italic "3. Playing various chords in any inversion"
        \hspace #0
        \wordwrap {
          With those skills, a guitarist could have an easier time improvising and composing using the entire range of the guitar. They could use chord voicings on any area of the guitar fretboard, and switch easily between them. They can have a lot more variation in their playing, since they can play familiar chords in many different ways. And they probably focus on creating good music instead of worrying about where to put their hands.
        }
        \hspace #0
        \wordwrap {
          This book is not the only way to learn these skills, it only shows one path towards them.

          If you can read tablature, and you know what chords and scales are, you can learn from this book.

          But you can learn even more if you know about basic music theory, especially about keys, diatonic chords, modes, and chord inversions.

          You don't need to read standard notation here. But it's a good advantage if you can. It makes things a hell of a lot easier, especially for figuring out how chord inversions all fit together.

          - When learning a new exercise, take it slow. It takes time for the brain to remember these movements and it's easier to learn by going slowly. In an odd way, slower practice leads to faster results.
