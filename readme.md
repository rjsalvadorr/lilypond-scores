# Get Good at Guitar Inversions

_Exercises for improving fluency on guitar_

&nbsp;

## What is this book?

This book started as a personal collection of exercises to get better at improvising on guitar, but it turned into a compact system that could help other guitarists as well. So I cleaned up what exercises I had, and decided to share this with others.

I've laid out sixteen exercises for improving guitar fluency by memorizing a series of patterns on the fingerboard. These patterns all build on each other, and are especially effective when combined with music theory knowledge.

I hope you learn something cool here.
