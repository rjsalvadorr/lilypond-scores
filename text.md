# Get Good at Guitar Inversions

_Exercises for improving fluency on guitar_

## Preface

### What is this book?

This book started as a personal collection of exercises to get better at improvising on guitar, but it turned into a compact system that could help other guitarists as well. So I cleaned up what exercises I had, and decided to share this with others.

I've laid out sixteen exercises for improving guitar fluency by memorizing a series of patterns on the fingerboard. These patterns all build on each other, and are especially effective when combined with music theory knowledge.

I hope you learn something cool here.

### Why should I use this book?

The exercises here build up technical and improvisation mastery by building on three main skills:

1. Playing melodies over various chords
1. Playing various chords in any position on the fretboard
1. Playing various chords in any inversion

With those skills, a guitarist could have an easier time improvising and composing using the entire range of the guitar. They could use chord voicings on any area of the guitar fretboard, and switch easily between them. They can have a lot more variation in their playing, since they can play familiar chords in many different ways. And they probably focus on creating good music instead of worrying about where to put their hands.

This book is not the only way to learn these skills, it only shows one path towards them.

### What do I need to know before using this?

If you can read tablature, and you know what chords and scales are, you can learn from this book.

But you can learn even more if you know about basic music theory, especially about keys, diatonic chords, modes, and chord inversions.

You don't need to read standard notation here. But it's a good advantage if you can. It makes things a hell of a lot easier, especially for figuring out how chord inversions all fit together.

### How do I use this properly?

Practice the exercises that would get you closer to your goals. Each chapter's introduction will explain the specific skills that are improved by each set of exercises. Read those to figure out how these workouts can help you out!

At the end of the day, use this book however you like. I encourage you to experiment and find a way that works for you.

#### Author's Recommendations

+ Take 10 minutes to practice any exercises on practice days. These exercises can get boring quickly, and become less effective if you play them for too long.
+ Follow the repeat sign on the exercises, playing each chosen exercise twice in a row.
+ When learning a new exercise, take it slow. It takes time for the brain to remember these movements and it's easier to learn by going slowly. In an odd way, slower practice leads to faster results.

## Chapter 1 - Arpeggios

Arpeggios are an essential element for skillful improvisation and composition. They're used in countless melodies, and many accompaniment parts use nothing but block chords and arpeggios. 

I put these exercises first because they're so useful, versatile, and ubiquitous. Knowledge of arpeggios can be applied right away to create good music. If you're going to learn only one exercise set from this book, this is the one I'd recommend.

### Exercise 1A

This chord progression is commonly found in jazz and pop music. It also gives us a chance to practice two forms of major and minor arpeggios (on the A string and the low E string).

### Exercise 1B

Major chords, and a diminished arpeggio starting on the A string.

### Exercise 1C

Minor chords, and a diminished arpeggio starting on the E string.

## Chapter 2 - Scales and modes

Many guitarists encounter scales and modes as the mainstays of boring practice routines. Well, they're also the mainstays of effective practice routines. And they don't have to be boring, if you know how to apply them properly. Scale practice improves the skills needed for lightning-fast runs, and staying in key while improvising melodies.

This chapter will cover the seven diatonic modes in Western Music:

1. Ionian mode _(widely known as the Major Scale)_
1. Dorian mode
1. Phrygian mode
1. Lydian mode
1. Mixolydian mode
1. Aeolian mode _(a.k.a. the Natural minor scale)_
1. Locrian mode

If you don't know what modes are, this chapter may be challenging for you. In that case, you can still do the exercises and worry about the theory stuff after. Your fingers can learn the scales & modes before your brain does, and things will 'click' once you learn the theoretical concepts behind modes. Even if you have familiarity with these concepts, the exercises should help you play them more fluently.

Similar to the previous chapter, we'll be practicing scale movements through chord progressions. Since there are so many modes and multiple ways to go through them, this chapter contains the most exercises in the book. It's a lot of material, but definitely worth the effort. This might sound far-fetched, but scales are very effective for building just about any guitar-related skill when adapted properly. (Some of these adaptations will be covered in chapter 3).

### Exercise 2A

In the major key, the _ionian_, _lydian_, and _mixolydian_ modes start on the 1st, 4th, and 5th scale degrees (respectively).

### Exercise 2B

The same modes as in Exercise 2A, but with the _lydian_ and _mixolydian_ modes below the _ionian_.

### Exercise 2C

In the natural minor key, the _aeolian_, _dorian_, and _phrygian_ modes start on the 1st, 4th, and 5th scale degrees (respectively).

### Exercise 2D

The same modes as in Exercise 2C, but with the _dorian_ and _phrygian_ modes below the _aeolian_.

### Exercise 2E

Mixed modes. Introducing the diminished mode: _locrian_, starting on the low E string.

### Exercise 2F

Mixed modes, with the _locrian_ mode starting on the A string.

## Chapter 3 - Scale & Arpeggio Variations

Together, scales and arpeggios form the backbone of a serious guitarist's practice regimen. But they suffer from a serious drawback. They can become real boring when practiced the same way over and over again.

Boredom can make music practice less effective, and even worse: boredom can lead to quitting practice altogether. Scale & arpeggio variations can keep that boredom from wasting your time, and can even help you find new ways of playing.

## Chapter 4 - Three-string chord voicings

Three-string voicings are a great way to add some harmony to a melodic passage. Technically, they're also pretty efficient. Your fretting hand can form these chord shapes quickly, and you can move through most chords while barely moving your hand around the neck.

Learning these chord shapes can give your solos a fuller sound by supporting the melody with harmony. They also make it easier to transition between melodic and rhythmic playing.

### Exercise 4A

Major chord voicings on the lower strings.

### Exercise 4B

Minor chord voicings on the lower strings.

### Exercise 4C

Mixed voicings. Introducing two sets of diminished chord voicings.

### Exercise 4D

Focusing on mixed voicings on the upper strings.

## Chapter 5 - Open chord voicings

Classical and jazz guitarists are known for playing chords with plenty of space between the notes. These are usually played fingerstyle with the right hand. The thumb would hit the bass string, and the index, middle, or ring fingers would strike the upper strings.

Learning these voicings should give you the skills for playing on two areas of the fretboard at the same time. With enough practice, you can easily play a distinct bassline with a melody (plus accompaniment) all by yourself.

### Exercise 5A

Major and minor chords, starting on the low E and A strings.

### Exercise 5B

Major chords, and diminished voicings starting on the A string.

### Exercise 5C

Minor chords, and diminished voicings starting from the low E string.

## APPENDIX

### Technical details about exercises

All of the exercises in this book go through chord progressions that are used frequently in Western music. They were constructed to be "realistic", reflecting chord movements that musicians do all the time out in the real world. If these exercises are similar to actual music, it should be easier to apply the skills learned here.

The exercises follow two main formats: two-octave exercises, and chord voicings & inversions

#### Two-octave exercises

Scales or arpeggios covering two octaves. These exercises target melodic movements through the fretboard. The first half of the book focuses on these exercises. The exercises go through 20 total scale/arpeggio forms. There are 6 arpeggio forms for:

* Major chords
* Minor chords
* Diminished chords

And 14 forms for these scales and modes:

* Ionian mode _(widely known as the Major Scale)_
* Dorian mode
* Phrygian mode
* Lydian mode
* Mixolydian mode
* Aeolian mode _(a.k.a. the Natural minor scale)_
* Locrian mode

#### Chord voicings & inversions

Chord shapes, inversions, and voicings. These exercises target harmonic movements, and are helpful for accompaniment and rhythmic playing. The second half of the book focuses on these exercises.

They're grouped by strings, so any of those chord shapes can be moved along the strings to form the same chord around a different root note.

This book goes through 72 chord forms, with each chapter covering 3 chord types _(major, minor, diminished)_ and 3 inversions _(root position, 1st inversion, 2nd inversion)_:

* 36 three-string chord shapes, covering 4 string groups
* 18 open chord shapes, covering 2 string groups
* 9 bass chord shapes, covering 1 string groups
